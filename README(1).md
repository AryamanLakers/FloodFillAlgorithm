# Flood-Fill Algorithm Visualizer
I have implemented both the recursive as well as iterative approach of flood fill Algorithm which fills the color till it hits the end of grid of meets a blockage. The intuitive part to think is we can think in terms of graphs, like all the unfilled nodes [ grid elements ] can be represented by 1 and all the blockages can be represented by 0, so I just have to find 1 in the grid and run DFS or BFS on that part and mark each node as visited as our algorithm expands and then I just have to fill the color to elements or nodes representing 1.


## How to play?

- First select a tile and drag for created blockages
- Then press the start button to switch on the algorithm
- Click on any tile that you want your algorithm to start
